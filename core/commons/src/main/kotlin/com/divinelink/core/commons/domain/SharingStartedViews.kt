 * A [SharingStarted] meant to be used with a [StateFlow] to expose data to a view.
 *
 * When the view stops observing, upstream flows stay active for some time to allow the system to
 * come back from a short-lived configuration change (such as rotations). If the view stops
 * observing for longer, the cache is kept but the upstream flows are stopped. When the view comes
 * back, the latest value is replayed and the upstream flows are executed again. This is done to
 * save resources when the app is in the background but let users switch between apps quickly.

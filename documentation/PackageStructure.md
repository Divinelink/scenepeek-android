# Package Structure

Within our project's root package, packages are grouped by feature. The only exception is a core
module with classes that are shared across the application. Within a feature package, information is
split by responsibility. The ui code will go into one package, while the domain information in
another - which is then split by use cases, repositories, and model classes.
